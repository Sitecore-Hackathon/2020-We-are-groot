# SITECORE HACKATHON

## Topic

### Sitecore Meetup Website – 
In recent events the Meetup.com site began charging for the registering and hosting of meetings as well as other features previously free. Many of the Sitecore User Groups rely on Meetup

### Sitecore Marketplace Website – 
The Marketplace was once a destination for popular modules to be showcased to the community. Consider the ways in which modules can be shared and installed.

### Sitecore Hackathon Website – 
This idea is sooo meta! Several years have passed with the current version and it’s in need of a refresh.

Your mission, if you choose to accept, is to build a replacement website addressing one of the listed topics. Your entry will be judged on how complete your solution is and the quality of complete features. Be sure to document your requirements and have fun building!


## Requirements

We have selected to refurbish Sitecore Hackathon Website as rightly said it is so meta. We selected the SPA(Single page application) format and classic Sitecore approach to create the components.

The following are the requirements of the site we have developed:-

### Home page
1.	**Carousal**- The carousal on the homepage is the most important component on any site as it denotes what a site stands for. We have created the carousal and identified the most important information and CTAs which would redirect the user to the respective sections/pages.
2.	**About us section**- This denotes the most relevant information about the hackathon.
3.	**Our Panel**- The list of judges are shown in this section
4.	**Gallery**- We have tried to show the Pinterest images of the participants in the gallery section
5.	**FAQ**- The rules of the hackathon are mentioned here
### Registration Form

2.	The registration form has the submit button.
